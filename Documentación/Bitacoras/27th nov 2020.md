Today in our daily meeting, we check all the points conteined in the "description of the development process" document and marked the points that needed changes to be done.
We focus in the requirements section and refine other parts as the "teamwork" section and profile elements of our users. We finish the day with a another meeting where we 
approved all the points in the description document and the contribution tracker table was filled by the scrum master. 

With this binnacle is finished the first increment and we start the preparation for the monday presentation.
