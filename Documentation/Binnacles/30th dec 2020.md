Today we had another meeting with our mentor. We showed him our updated wireframe prototype that follows the feedback he gave us last week, and he told us that he was pleased with our changes. After having his approval, we can now officially conclude the wireframe design stage.

We also talked to him about the future of our project, in which he suggested that we adhere to making a high fidelity prototype instead of a full fletched web app.
