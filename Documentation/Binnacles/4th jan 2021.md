Today we finished working on the PowerPoint slides of our second increment presentation. For it, we took all the relevant information from the second increment document. Then, we verified that it included everything necessary, and finally, we organized said information in the slides alongside some pictures and graphs. This advancement was the final step in the increment before the live presentation.
