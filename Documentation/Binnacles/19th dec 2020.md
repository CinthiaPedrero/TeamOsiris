Today we successfully concluded one of our tasks. As a team, we finished working on designing the application's wireframe. For this, we went through the requirements document and implemented the ones classified as "Must" using _Figma_. We also set up interactions so that the prototype becomes dynamic and a more accurate representation of the completed application.
