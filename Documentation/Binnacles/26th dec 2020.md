In the latest meeting with our mentor, he provided us with feedback on our app's wireframe. He told us that it was confusing and that it wasn't very cohesive. Today, we assessed said feedback and looked for ways of improving the design. Then, we worked as a team in updating the *Figma* prototype, simplifying it and making it look like a traditional wireframe. We were satisfied with the final product, and we believe that it is better overall than the previous iteration because it follows a more straightforward design guide.
