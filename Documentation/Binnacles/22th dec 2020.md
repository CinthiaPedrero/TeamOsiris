Today I contact the users who were missing for the acceptance test, run the 5 second test and start writing my conclusions. That same day we met with the mentor to show him the progress of the documentation and the prototype of our project, during the meeting we talked about the aspects that we can improve and recommended other tools that we can use to make adjustments and changes to the document and prototype.
